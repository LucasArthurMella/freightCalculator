  "description": "This project is a freight calculator that chooses between two logistics operators which one has the lowest price and takes the least amount of time to deliver given a source address, a destination address, and product information (dimensions). The project also stores all queries in a database so that they can be consulted later. The frontend is made with ReactJS packaged by Vite and the backend is made with NestJS.",
